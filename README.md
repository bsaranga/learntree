# Learntree

## A platform that makes learning fun, engaging and simplified.


Oftentimes when we want to learn about something, we turn to google and start typing away, finding bits and pieces of information about certain topics, theories or concepts. Oftentimes we find ourselves typing “How to learn X”, “What are the prerequisites to learning Y”, “What is the order of learning X, Y, Z”. The internet has a wealth of information, but it lacks curated content that gives precise direction when we want to master something. Say hello to LearnTree!

### What is LearnTree?

LearnTree is a social network where you can create and subscribe to learning paths. A learning path is just like a mindmap with nodes and connections in between them. The nodes represent topics/subtopics, and the connections represent relationships between them, order, level, and requisites or preconditions. Learning paths on LearnTree are highly interactive. They contain embedded links to documents and videos from content providers or those that are freely available on the internet. 

### The Social Aspect of LearnTree

What makes LearnTree special is the social aspect. When you sign-up with LearnTree you can play two roles, a student, a mentor, or both. When you’re logged in as a mentor, you can create an interactive learning path for a specific subject, topic or subtopic. Once you create a learning path it goes into a public approval phase (PAP). In which even though it is visible to the public, other mentors can upvote it or downvote it. If a learning path acquires more downvotes than upvotes during the public approval phase, the learning path will get removed from public view. If the learning path garners significantly more upvotes, the learning path wins public approval and becomes a curated learning path which other learners can subscribe to.

### The Interactivity Of Learning Paths

Learning paths are highly interactive. Clicking on each topic will reveal links to documents and videos on the internet that go in detail into that topic. A learner who subscribes to a learning path can drag and order the nodes of the path to his/her liking, hide/show certain nodes, so they can create a custom view for themselves. Learning paths can have quizzes and flashcards embedded onto them. More to be written later.

### Subscription to Learning Paths

When a learner subscribes to a learning path, they will receive any updates made to it. The learner will have his own progress report of the path. Once they complete quizzes attached to learning paths, they achieve mastery over a certain set of nodes (topics).

### Public view of your learner profile

The public view of your learner profile will show which learning paths you’re following, your progress in them, and your streak.
